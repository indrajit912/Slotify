          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary" style="text-align: justify;">
            Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Indrajit, a Senior Research Fellow (SRF) at the Stat-Math Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore.
            I recently completed my PhD, and soon after my defense, I began thinking about giving away some of my books to students and
            fellow researchers who might find them useful.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary" style="text-align: justify;">
            Initially, I thought of simply sending out a list of books over WhatsApp or email. But then I realized that it could quickly
            become unmanageable â€” multiple people might request the same book, messages could overlap, and it would take a lot of time to
            coordinate everything manually. Thatâ€™s when I thought of creating a small web application to make things simpler.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary" style="text-align: justify;">
            The idea was straightforward: I would list my books on a simple web page, and anyone interested could click to book one for themselves.
            That way, Iâ€™d only need to contact the students who had actually booked specific items. It was meant to be a small, one-purpose tool â€”
            just for my own use â€” but it turned out to be something that others might find useful too.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary" style="text-align: justify;">
            Around the same time, I had already developed 
            <a href="https://slotify.pythonanywhere.com/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none fw-semibold">Slotify</a>,
            a platform used by research scholars and hostel residents to manage washing machine slot bookings. Since the infrastructure for
            hosting and user interaction was already in place, I decided not to create a completely separate domain for this new project.
            Instead, I integrated this new idea â€” the <strong>Marketplace</strong> â€” as a subdomain under Slotify.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary" style="text-align: justify;">
            The goal of the Marketplace is simple: to create a convenient space where students can list books or items they wish to give away
            or sell, and others can book them through a quick, secure email-based OTP verification. Itâ€™s minimal, clean, and community-driven â€”
            built by a researcher, for researchers and students.
          </p>
